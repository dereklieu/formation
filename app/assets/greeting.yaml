greetings:
  - Hello, hi, whatever
  - Hello. Also, not hello
  - It's nothing to meet you
  - Cool. Cool. Cool. We got this
  - If I had a heart, it would be pounding
  - It's our void now
  - "[chuckles awkwardly] This is fun"
  - All my fears are mine again
  - "I've narrowed it down to: yes and no"
